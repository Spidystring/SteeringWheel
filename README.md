What is this project about?

To hone my software and hardware skills, I decided to learn more about Arduino. The arduino is a simple microcontroller that is used by engineers or hobbyist for prototyping or cool projects. To start, I decided to purchase the Arduino Sensor Kit, where it features components and sensors such as:
- A button
- A potentiometer
- An Oled screen
- An Accelerometer

and many more!

After learning about a few of them, I have decided to create a steering wheel where I am able to stear it in a driving simualtor. Using the knowledge that I have learned from my final year project where I have to create controls linked to a flight simulator, I have decided to apply the same knowledge on creating a simple steering wheel where it uses the sensor data from the accelerometer to steer a car in a simulator.

Hence this project is about creating a "steering wheel" that can interact with any bluetooth device and display/output certain commands!

So far, the projects I have done with this "steering wheel" is:
- For a car simulator
- For a bluetooth car

More will be on the way, so stay tuned.

To be continued...
